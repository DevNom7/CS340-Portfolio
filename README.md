# CS340 Portfolio Reflection  

This repository contains my work for CS340. The reflection below summarizes what I learned from building a CRUD module in Python with MongoDB and then applying it to the Grazioso Salvare dashboard project.


## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?  
For this course, I learned how important it is to keep code simple, clean, and reusable. In Project One, I built a CRUD Python module that connected to MongoDB. By separating that logic into its own module, I was able to plug it right into the dashboard project later without rewriting everything. That made the code easier to maintain and also more adaptable for future work. I could use the same CRUD module again if I needed to build another app that connects to MongoDB , I’d just change the queries or collections, and the structure would still work.  

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?  
When I worked on the Grazioso Salvare dashboard, I broke the project into smaller steps instead of trying to solve everything at once. First, I figured out the database connection, then focused on queries, and finally connected it all to the widgets in the dashboard. Compared to earlier courses, this felt more like a “real” project because I had to think about how the pieces worked together, not just write one script. Going forward, I’d use the same strategy of building in small steps, testing as I go, and keeping my database design flexible so it can handle new client requests.  

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?  
Computer scientists solve problems by turning real-world needs into working software. In this case, my project gave Grazioso Salvare a way to see animal shelter data quickly and in a more useful way. That matters because it helps the organization make better decisions and work more efficiently. More broadly, computer scientists create tools that save time, reduce errors, and give people insights they might not get otherwise. This course showed me how the work I do as a student can actually translate into something useful for a company in the real world.
